## Influence of arithmetic precision in the study of two-dimensional isotropic turbulence
The following files are part of the research conducted for my Aerospace Engineering Dissertation Project. 

This study was focused on spectral method analysis and the 4th order Runge-Kutta integral time scheme, for Direct Numerical Simulation of two-dimensional isotropic turbulent flows.
